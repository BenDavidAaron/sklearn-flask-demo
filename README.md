# sklearn-flask-demo
Hey all, this is the demo app for my lighting talk at [this event](https://www.meetup.com/sfpython/events/250124870/).

In order to use the app, you need to run `generate_training_data.py` and `train_sgd_model.py` 
in order to get a working model to deploy in the app (You can also just pull and run the `master` branch).
