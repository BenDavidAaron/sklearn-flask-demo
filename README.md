# sklearn-flask-demo
Hey all, this is the demo app for my lighting talk at [this event](https://www.meetup.com/sfpython/events/250124870/).

To demonstrate loading and using a Scikit Learn estimator in a Flask app, you can just run `app.py` in a tmux session. Then run `make-requests.py` in another session, or check `0.0.0.0:33507` in your browser.
